        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are an enthusiastic FTC team passionate about robotics, engineering, and teamwork from Al-Hamra Academy. We have had experience before with robotics, as some of us have done FLL in the past. We learned how to program using blocks, build robots out of legos, and make acuators that are specifically design for missions.</p>

        <h2>Robot Designs & Evolution</h2>
        <p>We have built many robots in the past during FLL. We use to make small robots that we pretty basic but, by our last year, we were able to bulid robots that could easily tackle missions and built acuators that were very complex. </p>
    <section id="software">
        <h2>Software Development</h2>
        <p>During FLL, we use to use blocks. We would learn important ideas like how to use gyro to make precise movements but, we are now using java for our FTC season. This is mainly because we know that we will benefit more if we use java and we also created this website using HTML. We did this to share our programming and robot design throghout the season as it progresses. </p>

    <section id="community">
        <h2>Community Outreach & Mentoring</h2>
        <p>We are very active in the community as we are were able to educate FLL teams in middle school at the library about how to build better actuators. We did this as we know that we shouldn't just try to benefit from our knowledge, but spread it to others and allow others to benefit from it as well.</p>

            <h3>Taha Ismail</h3>
            <p>Taha is a 13 year old who is very passionate about math. He loves physical activity like running as well and loves food as well. He is very much interested in robotics primarily because of his brother. His brother did robotics before him and had encouraged Taha to do it as he thought he would enjoy it. Taha really loved robotics, and decided to join the FTC team as he wanted a new challenge other than FLL.</p>
